      <description>Chapter One It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</description>

      <description>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing. Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</description>

      <description>Now pleasing sleep had seal&#39;d each mortal eye,
Stretch&#39;d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:
The immortals slumber&#39;d on their thrones above;
All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.(76)
To honour Thetis&amp;rsquo; son he bends his care,
And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:
Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,
And thus commands the vision of the night.
&amp;ldquo;Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,(77)</description>
